This folder contains a simple Python script (main.py) accompanying:
(insert paper URL/DOI).
The script is designed to calculate non-linear density fluctuation power
spectra given the expansion function and gravitational constant suggested by an
alternative theory of gravity.

As provided the script calculates the powers spectra for the two models of the
generalized proca theories shown in the paper. It should be easily adaptable
to any other model by providing an expansion function and gravitational
constant for the desired model.

To adapt the script the user should provide a data file containing the expansion
function and gravitational constant for the desired alternative gravity model and
import this file in the script (see comments in file main.py).  
The expansion function and gravitational constant are expected to be provided
as a function of the scale factor a from a=0.001 to a=1.0 in 128 table steps
logarithmically spaced. The gravitational constant is additionally expected to be 
normalized to the reference GR value.

To excecute the script run: python main.py
